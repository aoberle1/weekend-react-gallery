## Description

Duration: Weekend Challenge

Created a single page application using React that displays a list of pictures to the DOM.  When pictures are clicked the picture disappears and the picture description is conditionally rendered.  Each picture has the picture's like count displayed, and a Like button that when clicked increases the displayed like count, and the picture's like count in the database.

Prerequisite Installs

Node.js

Installation
    - Upon cloning repo run npm install, 
    - Copy database information into postico with database named react_gallery, copy sql queries from database.sql into newly created database.
    - npm run server
    - npm run client

Usage
    - User is able to interact with pictures and like buttons on DOM - upon click of picture, picture description will appear (clicking again on description will revert back to picture display), and upon click of like button, like total for that picture will be increased on DOM, and in database.
